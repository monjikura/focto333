The code running = True and pass in Python assigns the boolean value True to the variable running. The pass statement is a null operation; when it is executed, nothing happens. It is often used as a placeholder where a statement is syntactically required, but no action needs to be taken. In this case, the and operator is redundant because pass itself doesn't return a value that can be logically combined with True.
