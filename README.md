The code running = True and pass in Python assigns the boolean value True to the variable running. The pass statement is a null operation; when it is executed, nothing happens. It is often used as a placeholder where a statement is syntactically required, but no action needs to be taken. In this case, the and operator is redundant because pass itself doesn't return a value that can be logically combined with True.

In the context of Linux x86-64, "denormals-are-zero" refers to a floating-point processing mode where denormalized numbers (also known as subnormal numbers) are treated as zero during calculations. This is achieved by enabling the "Flush-to-Zero" (FTZ) and "Denormals-Are-Zero" (DAZ) flags in the MXCSR (Masked Condition and Status Register) of the x86-64 processor.
